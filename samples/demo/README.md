# Radius Demo App

This application is used to demonstrate Radius basics as part of our 'first application' tutorial.

Visit https://radapp.io to try it out.

## Build the container image with a configured npm registry

To use the npm registry configured on the host, pass it to the container build:

```sh
docker build \
  --build-arg NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY="$(npm config get registry)" \
  --tag radius-demo:local \
  samples/demo
```
